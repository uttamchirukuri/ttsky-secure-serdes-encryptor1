## How it works

This project implements a Secure SERDES Encryptor that takes two serial input bit streams (a_bit and b_bit), combines them into 8-bit words, and encrypts them using a predefined 128‑bit key.
The encryption works as follows:

1] Serially shift in 8 bits for A and B.

2] Perform an XOR operation between A, B, and the least‑significant byte of the key.

3] Shift the encrypted result out bit‑by‑bit on the output line (uo_out[0]).

4] Once the full encrypted byte is transmitted, the done signal (uo_out[1]) goes high.

This design demonstrates a lightweight encryption method in a serial‑in serial‑out format, suitable for resource‑constrained hardware.

## How to test

1] Apply a reset by driving rst_n low and then high again.

2] Set ui_in[0] = 1 for one clock cycle to start encryption.

3] Provide 8 bits serially on ui_in[1] (a_bit) and ui_in[2] (b_bit), MSB first, one per clock cycle.

4] After 8 bits are loaded, the encryption logic computes the XOR result with the key.

5] The encrypted byte is then shifted out on uo_out[0] (1 bit per cycle).

6] When all 8 bits are output, uo_out[1] asserts high to indicate completion.

7] In simulation, you can monitor tb.vcd (waveform) or check the reconstructed byte from uo_out[0].

## External hardware
1] No external hardware is required.

2] For demo purposes, the cipher_out can be connected to an LED or serial interface to observe the bitstream.

3] The done signal can also be mapped to an LED to indicate completion of one encryption cycle.
